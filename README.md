> Although the goal of this toolkit is to promote progress in fake detection, we acknowledge that any open-source software may be misused by malicious actors.
> **We strongly discourage any use of the models or code for harmful purposes**, such as:
>
> * Bypassing biometric authentication
> * Creating or enhancing systems that generate fake or deceptive audio
>
> Some of the models included here perform well on public datasets, but may not generalize to unseen or adversarial scenarios. Please be aware of these limitations and use this repository responsibly and ethically.
