    "# What is Spoof Detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spoof detection (also known as anti-spoofing or fake audio detection) aims to detect whether an input audio sample is genuine (bonafide) or artificially generated/modified (spoofed). This is crucial for protecting automatic speaker verification systems and ensuring the authenticity of audio content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an audio input $x$, the goal is to produce a score $s$ that indicates how likely the input is genuine. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../_static/figures/detection.png\" width=\"300\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "In WeDefense, we model $s$ to LLR for final decision as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x \\xrightarrow{\\text{Model}} \\text{embedding} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Projection}} \\text{logits} \\xrightarrow{\\text{Calibration}} \\text{LLR score}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The final LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) score = $\\log \\frac{p(x|H_a)}{p(x|H_r)}$ determines the decision:\n",
    "- **Positive LLR** → classified as bonafide (real)\n",
    "- **Negative LLR** → classified as spoof (fake)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $H_a$ and $H_r$ represents the accept hypothesis (the input audio is real) and reject hypothesis (the input audio is fake), respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use LLR instead of raw posterior from network?\n",
    "\n",
    "While spoof detection can be framed as binary classification, we recommend using calibrated LLR scores instead of raw logits or posteriors for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prior-aware calibration**: LLR incorporates the prior probability of spoofing attacks, making it more suitable for real-world deployment where attack frequencies vary.\n",
    "2. **Interpretability**: LLR provides a principled decision threshold (0) with clear probabilistic meaning that $p(x|H_a) = p(x|H_r)$.\n",
    "3. **Robustness**: Calibrated scores are less sensitive to training data imbalance and generalize better across datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note,\n",
    "- Genuine/Bona fide/Real: Speech spoken by human or authentic audio naturally captured from real sources.\n",
    "- Spoof/Fake: Generated or modified audio (e.g., TTS, voice conversion, etc.)"

    "# Step-by-Step Implementation in WeDefense\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "The implementation stages in WeDefense are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stage 1–2:** Data preparation and list generation.\n",
    "- **Stage 3:** Model training.\n",
    "- **Stage 4:** Model averaging and embedding extraction.\n",
    "- **Stage 5:** Logit extraction (and optional posterior output via softmax).\n",
    "- **Stage 6:** Score calibration (logits to LLR).\n",
    "- **Stage 7:** Performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** \n",
    "1. WeDefense separates embedding extraction (Stage 4) from logit/posterior prediction (Stage 5) to keep the pipeline modular. This makes it easier to analyze or visualize embeddings, reuse the same embeddings with different back-end scoring methods, and debug each stage independently. \n",
    "2. For evaluation, we convert logits to LLR (Stage 6) to apply prior-aware calibration and obtain well-calibrated decision scores rather than using raw logits or posteriors directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following of this notebook, we provide a step-by-step guide to running a anti-spoofing detection experiment using the WeDefense toolkit. We will follow the structure of the `run.sh` script for the `detection/asvspoof5/v03_resnet18` recipe on the PartialSpoof dataset.\n",

    "Congratulations! You have successfully completed all the stages of training and evaluating an anti-spoofing model on the PartialSpoof dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learned how to:\n",
    "- **Prepare** a dataset in the standard Kaldi-style format.\n",
    "- **Format** the data for efficient training using shards.\n",
    "- **Train** a ResNet-based model.\n",
    "- **Extract** embeddings and logits for inference.\n",
    "- **Calibrate** scores and **evaluate** the system's performance using the EER metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- **Analyze the results:** Check the `results_eval.txt` file in your experiment directory for the final performance.\n",
    "- **Experiment with hyperparameters:** Try changing the model architecture, learning rate, or other parameters in the `conf/resnet.yaml` file.\n",
    "- **Embedding visualization:** You may also try to visualize the embedding extracted from the stage 4 following `wedefense/egs/embedding_visualization/embedding_visulization_umap.ipynb`."
